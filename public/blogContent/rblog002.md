# My First Parkrun

Six weeks ago I got up and decided to start running again, the first time for over 20 years.

>Old, overweight, and completely unfit. I needed an objective to get and keep going. I set completing my first parkrun (jogging and walking) without stopping on Saturday 2nd September 2017, at Poolsbrook Park, Chesterfield.

I am pleased to say that on Saturday 2nd September 2017 I achieved my objective, in 44 minutes and 37 seconds.

>During my training for this I have consistently used the Strava mobile app to record and inform people how I am doing.

### The Parkrun

The night before I set out my kit, made sure I had dry clothes incase of rain, set my alarm and setup sat nav... (the park run being over 8 miles from home).

Feeling very apprehensive, as I had not done a 5km distance and not really sure what the run was going to be like.

Well I got up, arrived the sun was shinning and found a group of people looking like they were going running.

It was well signed, so I knew where I had to go. After the first timers briefing I made my way to the start line, joining the 163 other runners. It being my first time, I headed to the back and quite expected to be enjoying the company of the tail walkers.

Although I combined jogging and walking, I was surprised how I managed, six weeks of training is not a lot but at no point did I think about stopping. It appears when you train in a very hilly area and then run on the flat it's a lot easier.

I found the event, to be well organised with very friendly people and a nice route. I think the best part was finishing, I knew I had completed my first goal to get back to fitness (still a long way to go), although very hot and very sweaty I received my token, and handed it in with my barcode. Shortly after my results were on the Parkrun website.

Thank you to everybody who organises the Park Run events and especially those on the Pools Brook for Saturday.

>I will be back.

### Whats Next

I really need to keep this running thing going, and as I used the Parkrun as motivation to start I will be using it as my continuing motivation, with two new goals.

>  **Complete 10 Parkruns by the end of 2017**  
>  **Be jogging / running (no walking) the Park run by the end of the 2017.**  

I think these are sensible goals, I have been unfit and overweight for over 20 years, and being realistic about my objectives hopefully means I will achieve them. ***(but not to easy).***

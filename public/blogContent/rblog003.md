# Three Months Injured

Been a while since my last post, here is a quick update.

The training was going well, I had got upto running 1k without having to walk, completed 4 park runs, **THEN**

>**INJURY HIT** October hated me running.

My knee started to hurt, and I made the mistake of thinking it was to do with lack of use and needed to be made stronger.   

>**Self diagnosis is dangerous.**

After two weeks of it getting worse, I went to the Doctors, and was told, complete rest and at least 6 weeks for it to recover.

It actually took until the week before Christmas to stop hurting, I then decided to leave it until after Christmas to start to train again.

>**3 Months Injured**

It has meant I didn't achieve my goals and lost the momentum to run. 

It is concerning to get back out there **running**. The thought of getting injured is right at the front of my mind, but I must.

Again my incentive is now to use the Park Run's, Strava and the associated groups of people, to get me remotivated.

The plan is to go for a preliminary run this weekend, seeing how the knee holds up. (When I say run I mean a fast walk and jog).

### A Nano Guide is:

>#### An eBook, which explains a specific area of a subject.

***Nano Guides are small, 20 – 30 pages long, detailed, economical and convenient. You may already have knowledge of a specific subject like JavaScript, but have a lack of knowledge in one area i.e. closure’s.  A Nano Guide will cover just that one area, saving having to buy a full manual or trawl the Internet for a series of blog posts.***

# The First Few steps

I used to be very fit, in my mid teens I swam at County Level, progressing to running cross country and marathons in my late teens and early twenties, and keeping fit (yep full six pack) until about 30.

I have just turned 53 and basically (excluding a few false starts) not been physically active for 20yrs, so really really unfit. The false starts have included the NHS couch to 5k training, online course etc etc, but I found that trying to stick to the routines actually put me off.

I woke up the day after my 53rd Birthday and went, ***I really need to do something about this***.

Having done so much training in the past I decided I would just apply what I knew. Not push to hard and slowly build up my fitnes. Starting with a sensible distance and walking a lot with some jogging inbetween, then building it up.  

> The key to this would be going out 3 times a week, being consistant and realising it took 20 years to get this unfit, ***There are no quick fixes***

Hence setting my first **GOAL** 
> **"be able to complete a Park Run by the first weekend in September".**


When I say complete, my aim is to walk or jog without stopping the full 5k. 
> *(Not something I would be able to do at the time of setting)*.


So I registered on the **[parkrun website](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/)** and then investigated how people kept motivated. One of the first things I found was **[Strava](https://www.strava.com/)** a useful site to enable me to keep track and set the runs I wanted to do. It enables me to share on instagram, and I have used it to not only keep track for myself, but also let my friends and others (it's a great community) know what I am upto.

I already had a lot of kit, including a fairly unused pair of running shoes (the only really important part of the kit). But I am very self concious of how people see me, so the current running takes place at night.

> **The Journey started with my first training on the *25th July 2017* a few days after my 53rd Birthday.**

>>This was a hard session as I was 15st 13 (223 pounds 101.15 kilos) **totally unfit** and even the walking bits hurt.

I am now on week 4 and have moved upto 3.8km walking & jogging combo. I am finding that the jogging parts are getting longer and the walking parts area getting easier.

I now feel confident that if I keep the consistency going I will be able to complete my first **Park Run** on schedule, and move on to my next set of **"Fitness Goals"** 

> **I look forward to seeing people at the Pools Brook Park Run on Saturday 2nd September 2017.**

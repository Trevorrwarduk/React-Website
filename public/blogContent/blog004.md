# ReactJS so far

Over the past month I have spent time learning and understanding the **ReactJS** JavaScript web development framework.

> This website is a result of that study.

How though did I get upto speed and be able in days to learn enough ReactJS to be able to develop web applications.

Firstly I think its worth mentioning I have been developing for the Web since the late 90's, and the last few years focusing on Mobile using the [Appcelerator Platform](http://www.appcelerator.com).

> ***This has given me an indepth knowledge of JavaScript and the [CommonJS Specification](http://www.commonjs.org/).***

Having this knowledge enabled me to do a quick `Google` and find an excellent [**course**](https://reacttraining.com/online/react-fundamentals) from ***Tyler McGinnis***. It took me a couple of days to go through the course, and I obtained a good understanding of the ReactJS framework.

> I have found ReactJS an obvious way to develop *web applications*. It works in a way that makes sense, is easy to understand and separate the application sections.

Some developers find combining the HTML within the JavaScript components is against best practices, but for ReactJS it is the ideal solution.

> A major factor in developing with ReactJS is the community, who have written Node modules covering most areas required.

> However this also makes ReactJS sometimes a little dull, it is quick and easy to develop, but I have yet to find a module I need to write.

There are a few basic requirements to quickly Learn and get productive with ReactJS.

*  Understanding the CommonJS architecture
*  Being a JavaScript developer
*  Understanding HTML and CSS
*  Knowing how the DOM works

> This knowledge is easy to obtain by using the multitude of resources, which are available on the web, Youtube or online courses.

I can see a few potential issues with writing ReactJS applications, mainly in the size of the application file. It can take a while to download.

> Once downloaded though the speed and potential functionality is excellent.

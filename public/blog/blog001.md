# <span style="color: #EA601A; font-family: HoboStd">The New Website<span>  

I am currently working on bringing my online presence into one area. This site will have all the content from my other sites
[<span style="color: #EA601A; font-family: HoboStd">**untward**</span>](http://www.untward.com) and
[<span style="color: #EA601A; font-family: HoboStd">**thewarpedcoder**</span>](http://www.thewarpedcoder.net).  



### <span style="color: #EA601A; font-family: HoboStd">The Tech</span>
This site uses the **REACT** framework, and the content is written using Markdown. This enables quick and easy updates to the main content.  

There is no backend or API's in use.

>Not fully responsive yet. (it's on my todo list)

### <span style="color: #EA601A; font-family: HoboStd">The Future</span>
Currently this site uses no backend API. The intention as time permits is to develop a **JSON** feed, providing details of the blog posts, which then allows for a simple API free Markdown blog.  



>If you want to follow what I get upto, hook up on Social Media for regular updates.

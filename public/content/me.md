# Bio

With over 25 years in the IT industry, I have been fortunate to use a multitude of technologies. Being first, and foremost, a developer, currently building enterprise mobile applications using the Appcelerator Toolset and node.js, with knowledge and experience of development methodologies, techniques and team management.

Within programming I find the most interesting aspect is the project itself. Although a JavaScript and open source advocate, I do not restrict myself to any one technology and instead take the approach of the project dictates the required solution. This has resulted in a depth of experience in researching, learning and implementing new technologies.
